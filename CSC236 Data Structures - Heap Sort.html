<h2>Heaps and Heap Sort</h2>
<br>

<h3>Heaps</h3>

<p>There are two types of heaps: minheaps and maxheaps. Both are complete binary trees.</p>

<p>A <i>maxheap</i> is a complete binary tree where, for each node, the value in the
node is greater than the values in the node's children. There is no restriction
on the relationship of the values in the children, like there is in a BST.</p>

<p>A <i>minheap</i> is a complete binary tree where, for each node, the value in the
node is less than the values in the node's children. There is no restriction
on the relationship of the values in the children, like there is in a BST.</p>

<p>So a heap has two requirements: the shape requirement (it must be a complete
binary tree) and the ordering requirement, which is different for minheaps and
maxheaps. Here are two sample heaps. Notice that the left child and right
child of a node do not have to follow any rule regarding which is larger
or smaller.</p>

<h4>Maxheap</h4>

<h4>Minheap</h4>

<p>For the rest of this handout we will discuss maxheaps.</p>

<h4> Insert</h4>

<p>To insert into a heap, we add the new element as a new rightmost leaf. This preserves the shape
needed for the heap, but the new value may violate the ordering property of the heap. If the new
value is greater than the parent, we swap it with the parent, repeating until the new value
is in a valid position. We call this operation "sift up".</p>

<img src="./CSC236 Data Structures - Heap Sort_files/heap.insert.png">

<p>Sift up works on the path from the new node to the root. At each step we need to compare the new node
and the parent, so that is one comparison at each step. In the worst case we must sift all the
way up to the root, which is log(N) steps.</p>

<h4>Delete</h4>

<p>We delete from the root of the heap. This leaves a hole that must be filled. To preserve the heap
shape, we replace the root item with the item from the rightmost leaf, and then delete that leaf.
This will put a value in the root, call it v, which is too small to satisfy the heap ordering property. To
correct this problem we perform "sift down" on v. In sift down we swap v with the larger of
its children. This makes the root value valid, but v may still be smaller than its children, so we
must repeat the sift down until v is in a valid position.</p>

<img src="./CSC236 Data Structures - Heap Sort_files/heap.delete.png">

<p>Sift down works on the path from the root to a leaf. At each stage we need to compare the children
to find which is larger, and then compare the larger child to the parent. If the parent is smaller then
we need to swap it with the larger child. So that is two comparisons at each step. In the worst case
we must sift all the way down to a leaf, which is log N steps. Thus we see that insert and delete
are both O(log N).</p>

<h3>Storing Heap in an Array</h3>

<p>Since the heap is a complete binary tree it is easy to store it in an array:</p>

<ul>
<li>the root is in arr[0]</li>
<li>for a node in location k, the left child is in location 2k+1, the right child is in
location 2k+2</li>
<li>the parent of the node at location k is in location (k-1)/2 (using integer division)
</li></ul>

<pre>323  252  282  121  131  222  141   66  111   85
[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]  [9]
</pre>

<h3>Heap Sort</h3>

<p>Heapsort uses a maxheap in an array. The first phase builds the heap in the
array. The second phase is like selection sort: each pass takes the largest (the
root of the heap, in array[0]), removes it from the heap and moves it to the end
of the array. After the heap is fixed up this step is repeated, removing
the new root of the heap and moving it to the second-from-the-end of the array.
This is repeated until the whole array is sorted.</p>

<h4>Build Heap</h4>

<p>The heap is built from the bottom up. The leaves are valid heaps, so the
first stage is to make heaps out of the parents of the leaves, and then
their parents, until the whole array has been turned into a heap. To make
heaps we use the same sift down function described above. In the code
below, start is the subscript of the root of the heap (the value that
needs to sift down), and end is the subscript of the last element in
the heap.</p>

<pre>   siftDown(arr, start, end) {
      root = start
      while (root * 2 + 1 &lt;= end) {
         lchild = root * 2 + 1            // subscript of left child
         swap = root
         if (arr[swap] &lt; arr[lchild])
            swap = lchild                 // should swap root &amp; left child
         if (lchild + 1 &lt;= end &amp;&amp; arr[swap] &lt; arr[lchild+1])
            swap = lchild + 1              // should swap root &amp; right child
         if (swap != root) {              // if one of children is greater
            swap(arr[root],arr[swap])     // swap root &amp; larger child
            root = swap
         }
         else
            return
   }
</pre>

<p>One call to siftdown takes care of moving the root value to a valid location
in one heap. To build a heap in the array we need to call it for all of the
internal node positions of the heap. It can be proved that half of the nodes
in a complete tree are leaves. This means that for an array of N nodes
the non-leaf nodes are in array locations 0 through size/2-1. We call siftdown
for each of the non-leaves, starting from the lowest non-leaves and working up
to the root.</p>

<pre>   heapify(arr, size) {
      start = size/2 - 1                   // last non leaf
      while (start &gt;= 0) {
         siftdown(arr, start, size-1)
         start = start - 1
      }
   }
</pre>

<p>Once the heap has been built, we can sort as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>swap first and last (move largest to end)
</li><li>fix heap: sift new root down till in valid position, cutting last element
out of the heap: siftdown(arr, 0, last-1)
</li><li>repeat, cutting off the last item each time
</li></ol>

<pre>   heapsort(arr, size) {
      heapify(arr,size)
      last = size -1                       // subscript of last item
      while (last &gt; 0) {
         swap(arr[last], arr[0])
         last = last - 1
         siftdown(arr, 0, last)
      }
   }
</pre>
